/**
 * Universal Timer.
 *
 * Features:
 * - intended use: encapsulate recurring and non-recurring timed actions with a non-busy wait approach for time spans in a range of 10 to thousands of milliseconds, such as:
 *   - debouncing push-button and switch signals
 *   - blink some LEDs
 *   - schedule some sequences where time accuracy is not crucial
 *   - implements Arduino yield() function in order to keep the timers scheduling ongoing even while applications and drivers use the Arduino delay() function
 * - configurable to be either
 *   - recurring (timer automatically restarts after the interval) or
 *   - non-recurring (timer stops after timeout period is over)
 * - timer interval/timeout time configurable ([ms])
 * - automatically attaches to TimerContext's linked list of Timer objects. As long as the
 *   TimerContext::handleTick() will be called (use global functions yield() or scheduleTimers() to do so),
 *   this will periodically update the timers' states and thus perform the timers' expire evaluations
 * - based on millis() function (number of milliseconds since the Arduino board began
 *   running the current program), handles unsigned long int overflows correctly
 *   (occurring around every 50 hours)
 *
 * Integration:
 *
 * (shown on the basis of a simple application toggling the Arduino board's built-in LED)
 *
 * - Include
 *
 *       #include "Timer.h"
 *
 * - Timer interval constant definition
 *
 *       const unsigned int BLINK_TIME_MILLIS = 200;
 *
 * - specific TimerAdapter implementation, periodically toggling the built-in LED
 *
 *       class BlinkTimerAdapter : public TimerAdapter
 *       {
 *       public:
 *         void timeExpired()
 *         {
 *           digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, !digitalRead(LED_BUILTIN));
 *         }
 *       };
 *
 * - Setup: set LED pin to output; create recurring Timer, inject specific TimerAdapter
 *
 *       //The setup function is called once at startup of the sketch
 *       void setup()
 *       {
 *         pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
 *         new Timer(new BlinkTimerAdapter(), Timer::IS_RECURRING, BLINK_TIME_MILLIS);
 *       }
 *
 * - Loop: call yield(), the Arduino scheduler function
 *
 *       // The loop function is called in an endless loop
 *       void loop()
 *       {
 *         yield();
 *       }
